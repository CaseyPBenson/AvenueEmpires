# 1.0 Introduction
In Avenue Empires, players take on the roles of rulers working to build the most prestigious and prosperous city. Players trade cards to one another while building their own cities, but they must be careful to be certain that they aren't trading away goods that would benefit their neighbor more than themselves!

## 1.1 Objective
You win by having the city worth the most Victory Points (VPs) at the end of the game. The game ends immediately when there are no more cards left in the deck. 

# 2.0 Components
* One rulebook
* Cards

## 2.1 Cards
Cards are drawn drawn during the Production Phase, traded during the Trading Phase, built during the Building Phase.

**2.1.1** 
There are $NUMBER cards in Avenue Empires. A card consists of 4 sections:
1. The card name.
2. The card's rules text.
3. An abbreviated version of the card's rules text, for quick reference.
4. The card's art.

# 3.0 Game Setup
Shuffle the deck of cards and place it in a location central to all players. 

# 4.0 Playing the Game
Avenue Empires is divided into 3 phases: the Trading Phase, the Building Phase, the Production Phase, and the Cleanup Phase.
**4.0.1**
If the text on a card contradicts the rules, the card's text takes priority.

## 4.1 Production Phase
During the Production Phase, each player draws three cards from the central deck and puts them into their hand.

## 4.2 Trading Phase
During the Trading Phase, each player simultaneously and secretly chooses two cards in their hand to trade away to their left-hand and right-hand neighbors.
**4.1.1**
After all players have chosen their trades, each player will receive two new cards from their neighbors, which are added to their hand.

## 4.3 Building Phase
During the Building Phase, each player simultaneously chooses one card from their hand to build in one of the three avenues in front of their Castle.
**4.2.1**
The Castle is you, the player, and is not represented by a card. Some cards may refer to the Castle, and the Castle is considered the first building in each Avenue.
**4.2.2**
Players have three Avenues in their city: the Left Avenue, the Center Avenue, and the Right Avenue.
**4.2.3**
When building in an avenue, the building is always built at the end of the avenue, beyond any already-built buildings.
**4.2.4**
Buildings are connected when they are next to each other orthogonally in the same avenue or in different avenues.

## 4.4 Cleanup Phase
During the Cleanup Phase, each player discards all remaining cards in their hand to the discard pile.

# 5.0 Scoring and Victory
When the deck runs out of cards, the game immediately ends and scores are tallied based off of each card's rules text.
**5.1**
The player with the most VP has the most prosperous empire, and wins the game.

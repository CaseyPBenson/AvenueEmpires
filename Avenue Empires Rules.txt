# 1.0 Introduction
In Avenue Empires, players take on the roles of rulers working to build the most prestigious and prosperous city. Players trade cards to one another while building their own cities, but they must be careful to be certain that they aren't trading away goods that would benefit their neighbor more than themselves!

## 2.1 Building Cards
**2.1.1** 
There are 60 Building Cards in Avenue Empires. A Building Card consists of 3 sections:
1. The card name.
2. The card's rules text.
3. An abbreviated version of the card's rules text, for quick reference.

**2.1.2**
Cards are drawn during the Production Phase, traded during the Trading Phase, and built during the Building Phase.

# 3.0 Game Setup
**3.1** 
Shuffle the deck of Building Cards and place it in a location central to all players, then deal out player's starting hands, if any. 
**3.1.1**
In a four- or five-player game, do not deal a starting hand to any player.
**3.1.2**
In a three-player game, deal a starting hand of two Building Cards to each player.
**3.1.3**
In a six-player game, deal a starting hand of one Building Card to each player.

# 4.0 Playing the Game
Avenue Empires is divided into 

## 4.1 Production Phase
During the Production Phase, each player draws 3 Building Cards from the central deck and puts them into their hand, if possible.
**4.1.2**
The deck of Building Cards will run out after several rounds of play. When this occurs, players skip the Production Phase.

## 4.2 Trading Phase
During the Trading Phase, each player simultaneously and secretly chooses two Building Cards in their hand to trade away to their left-hand and right-hand neighbors.
**4.2.1**
After all players have chosen their trades, each player will receive two new Building Cards from their neighbors, which are added to their hand.
**4.2.2**
The Trading Phase does not occur during the final round of play, as each player will only have a single card remaining in their hand.

## 4.3 Building Phase
During the Building Phase, each player simultaneously chooses one Building Card from their hand to build in one of the three Avenues in front of their Castle.
**4.3.1**
The Castle represents you, the player, and is not represented by a card. Some cards may refer to the Castle, and the Castle is considered the first Building in each Avenue.
**4.3.2**
Players have three Avenues in their city: the Left Avenue, the Center Avenue, and the Right Avenue.
**4.3.3**
When building in an Avenue, the building is always built at the end of the Avenue, beyond any already-built Buildings.
**4.3.4**
Buildings are considered adjacent if they are next to each other orthogonally in the same Avenue, or in seperate Avenues.

# 5.0 Scoring and Victory
When all Building Cards have been played, the game is concluded and scores are tallied based off of each card's rules text.
**5.1** 
Rivers, Roads, and Wall Buildings are all worth 1 VP each if they are adjacent to another River, Road, or Wall, respectively.
_NOTE: This applies even if the rules text is not on any of the cards involved. For instance, two Tunnels next to each other would be worth 4 VP by themselves: 2 VP as a length-2 Road, and 2 VP as a length-2 Wall._
**5.2**
The player with the most VP has the most prosperous empire, and wins the game.
* In case of a tie, the player with the longest Wall has demonstrated their mastery of construction, and wins the game.
* If the game is still tied, the player with the longest Road has demonstrated their mastery of trade, and wins the game.
* If the game is still tied, the player with the longest River has demonstrated their mastery of agriculture, and wins the game.
* If the game is still tied, each tied player enters a lengthy and embittered rivalry with one another and must begrudgingly accept a shared victory.

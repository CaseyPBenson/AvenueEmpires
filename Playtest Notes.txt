-20 cards per player is too many
-Patio is really bad: hard to achieve the objective.
-VP if next to a trail cards are bad; should either give more VP or count as the thing they want to be next to

-15 cards per player is still too many. Decision space is too huge and makes it easy to do beneficial trades
-Patio is actually really good since it can basically be used as a fake Gatehouse. Maybe tweak it a bit
-Vista is extremely good, Gatehouse is slightly worse, Patio is the worst of the three but all 3 of these play off each other - just buiding straight out gets tons of points and theres no incentive to trade
-Final scoring is a bit tricky due to the cards
-dual land are super good and easy to achieve their passive bonus
